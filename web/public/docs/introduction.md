# Introduction

JanoFidel (ጃኖ ፊደል) is a high-level transpiler designed to bring Amharic semantics to the JavaScript ecosystem. It allows developers to express complex logic using native linguistic patterns without sacrificing technical efficiency.


## Our Philosophy

In a world where technology often reflects a single cultural perspective, JanoFidel was born from a desire to empower developers to work in an environment that feels natural and intuitive. We believe that coding should not be a linguistic barrier, but a tool for creative expression. By enabling developers to write code in Amharic, we hope to foster a new generation of programmers who can build amazing things without having to sacrifice their cultural identity.


## Key Features

- **Cultural Resonance**: Code in the script you think in. JanoFidel's syntax is designed to be as close as possible to natural Amharic, making it easy to learn and use for Amharic speakers.
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Don't compromise on power. JanoFidel fully supports modern JavaScript features, including Async/Await, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), ES6+ modules, and more.
- **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: JanoFidel compiles to clean, human-readable JavaScript with no performance overhead. You can inspect the output and even use it in existing JavaScript projects.
- **Strong Typing (Soon)**: We are working on adding support for static type checking to help you build robust and maintainable applications.

## Who is this for?

JanoFidel is for anyone who wants to write code in Amharic. Whether you are a student, a professional developer, or just curious about programming, we invite you to join our community and start building with JanoFidel.

We are excited to see what you will build with JanoFidel!
